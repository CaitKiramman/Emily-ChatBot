# Emily-ChatBot
This is my first chatbot coded in Python.
Description:

This Python script creates a simple chatbot application using the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The chatbot, named Emily, 
interacts with users by responding to their inputs based on predefined responses in Greek.
The user types a message in the input field, and the chatbot displays a relevant answer based on the input.

The chatbot can handle greetings, casual inquiries, and farewells, responding with preset answers.
If the chatbot doesn't recognize the input, it will prompt the user to try something else.
The application has a clean GUI, with the chat area and input field properly positioned within the window.
It also supports interaction via both the "Send" button and the Enter key.
